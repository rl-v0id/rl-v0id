## 🗂️ Portfolio Highlights

### 1) Sample Red Team Engagement — Multi-Stage Attack Chain

- Objective: Domain compromise via phishing + AD lateral movement (SAMPLE)
- Recon: OSINT, email enum, SPF/DMARC checks
- Initial Access: OAuth consent phishing (SAMPLE tenant)
- Priv Esc: Token impersonation, Kerberoasting
- Lateral Movement: PSRemoting, SMB, WMI
- Data Exfil: S3 exfil via signed URLs (lab)
- Detection/Defense: Wrote Sigma rules for unusual OAuth grants
